This repository contains lecture slides, coding notebooks, recordings, and videos for courses developed by Parisa. 

**Slides**

PDF slides of the lectures. Will get updated every time I teach the course. Feel free to use the material, but please keep an acknowledgment for the figures/slides developed by me.

**educational_slides**

These are short videos recorded by me to help people review some of the basic concepts and I use them as pre-class assignments. Feel free to use them as is (please acknowledge my contribution) or as inspiration for better versions. I'd love to have your suggestions on how to improve these or to replace these with better videos you made.

**python_notebooks**

A series of educational python notebooks (and the required files for them) that I use as in-class hands on activity or post-class hands on activity. Some of these are adopted from other publicly available codes (which I have cited on top of the code). Please add a comment if you have any suggestions for making these better and I will include them and add your name to the code.

NOTE: Many of these notebooks require pyrosetta (see [here](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks) for instructions).
