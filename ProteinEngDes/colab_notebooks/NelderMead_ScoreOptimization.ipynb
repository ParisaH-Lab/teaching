It can be applied to functions for which we don't know the derivative, thus it is a suitable method for optimizing parameters of a score function by optimizing its performance on multiple tasks simultanuously.\n","\n","This algorithm works by calculating the value of the function given starting parameters and then calculating the value of the center of the mass. Based on the calculated values, it can choose one of several actions: *reflect, expand, contract inwards or outwards, shrink*. It stops when it converges. \n","\n","In this activity we employ Nelder-Mead optimization to train parameters of a simple score function.
